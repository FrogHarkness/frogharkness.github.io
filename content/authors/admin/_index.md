I am a 2B math student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Finance. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in data science and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Also, I got a deep passion for road biking and long-distance running.
 
Currently Seeking for 2024 Summer Coop

Hola, I'm a math UG from UWaterloo, Canada.  
This website used to be a CV repo for my Resume,but I’d like to make it more personal now, something regardless of science and tech things.

Something about the mission:

Many of us naturally seek stability; stability increases our chances of survival, and surviving means satisfying only our most basic biological need. Yet for the mavericks on a mission, this drive isn’t confined to a single individual or a select few. Instead, it’s a mindset—a call to arms that belongs to everyone, in every room and in every corner of the world. 
This mindset is not a special gift bestowed upon a few; it is the drive that can lead millions to freedom, inspire movements, and transform lives. It calls for a commitment to craft solutions that are as versatile as the challenges faced, and to act with the resolve that every wound, no matter how deep, can be healed.

So, embrace this mission as your own. Let the spirit of a healer guide you to look beyond the surface, to mend not only broken reality but also fractured hearts and communities. When faced with adversity, remember that the power to change the world lies not in a singular act, but in the collective, daring mindset of those who refuse to let challenges go unanswered.

Get out there and make it happen—your unique mission might just be the all-purpose remedy the world needs.

There is no universal remedy, no magic potion that heals every affliction. Perhaps one day, you and I will become that all-purpose medicine—a force capable of healing anything, even an entire nation. I truly believe that no disease in this world is beyond cure, a conviction I developed during my time at Brain Canada.

Someday, we may meet again
Even if nobody knows where the life goes through to
Someday, we may meet again
With the figures as we were in farewell

Thank you for visiting my website!
