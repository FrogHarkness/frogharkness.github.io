Hola, I'm a math UG from UWaterloo, Canada.  
This website used to be a CV repo for my Resume,but I’d like to make it more personal now, something regardless of science and tech things.
Maybe I don't really want to know

How your garden grows

I just want to fly

Random Thoughts:

A:
Many of us naturally seek stability; stability increases our chances of survival, and surviving means satisfying only our most basic biological need. Yet for the mavericks on a mission, this drive isn’t confined to a single individual or a select few. Instead, it’s a mindset—a call to arms that belongs to everyone, in every room and in every corner of the world. 
This mindset is not a special gift bestowed upon a few; it is the drive that can lead millions to freedom, inspire movements, and transform lives. It calls for a commitment to craft solutions that are as versatile as the challenges faced, and to act with the resolve that every wound, no matter how deep, can be healed.

Thoughts B:
Get out there and make it happen—your unique mission might just be the all-purpose remedy the world needs.

There is no universal remedy, no magic potion that heals every affliction. Perhaps one day, you and I will become that all-purpose medicine—a force capable of healing anything, even an entire nation. I truly believe that no disease in this world is beyond cure, a conviction I developed during my time at Brain Canada.

C: 
If possible, i wish I can start my whole life over
